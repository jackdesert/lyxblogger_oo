LyXBlogger 0.43 TODO
===================

Verify that url typed correctly before saving to config, even if no password given
Fail gracefully if url not found
get a default test to pass in test_lyxblogger.py
fix so that temp password is used
test with old versions of config files to ensure backwards compatibility
fix so that accounts can be verified reliably without time delay
allow either elyxer_entry or lyxhtml_entry, based on header
careful interaction design of what exactly we want to display and when
set up basic install script to install dependencies only
flush out test_lyxblogger.py so that it can demo the site
