LyXBlogger Demo
==============

This is a LyXBlogger demo, given to Good Guide for a demonstration of my Object Oriented programming skills.


What's different in this version?
--------------------------------

This version is OBJECT ORIENTED. Previous to this version (0.43), LyXBlogger was written using a structured paradigm. 


Where is the class diagram?

Where is the code?
-----------------

The code is in lyxblogger/LyxBlog. 


Where are the tests?
-------------------

The tests are also in lyxblogger/LyxBlog


How do I run it?
----------------

First install the wordpresslib dependency:

    cd lyxblogger/INSTALL
    sudo python setup_dependencies.py install

Wordpresslib is now installed on your machine. You can now try out LyXBlogger

    cd lyxblogger/LyxBlog
    python lyxblogger.py ../test_samples/original.elyxer_html
